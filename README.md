# UNR-GameTheorySimplexMethod
Solving Nash Equilibrium and Optical Strategies using the Simplex Method. Written in C++.

The project revolves around solving 2x2, 3x3, and 4x4 non cooperative sequential games in Game Theory. The game must be a zero sum game. 
This project is a console project and should be able to take in any payoff matrix of the above dimensions and output the value of the game,
and the optimal strategy of the game. The output is received using a Linear Programming approach called Simplex Method.
